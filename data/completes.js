    It/s time to broaden your perspective with a trip down below, to The Deep. Our friend Nate Reifke, a.k.a. Salty Timbers, is back with some mind-bending graphics from the abyss for the all new The Deep Collection. Reach to the depths of your senses, with Nate’s signature style of black and white illustration positioned over colorful splattered backdrops. To top it off, or should we say bottom it off, we’ve taken these boards even deeper with exposed Black Burle veneers. While you’re all probably familiar with the Fat Wave and Fault Line shapes, we’re also introducing the Strand for the first time ever in a 7 ply Maple construction. Some vivid graphics on some solid shapes are sure to make all your trips wild with The Deep Collection.
