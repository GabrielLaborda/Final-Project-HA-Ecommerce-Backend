    It/s time to broaden your perspective with a trip down below, to The Deep. Our friend Nate Reifke, a.k.a. Salty Timbers, is back with some mind-bending graphics from the abyss for the all new The Deep Collection. Reach to the depths of your senses, with Nate’s signature style of black and white illustration positioned over colorful splattered backdrops. To top it off, or should we say bottom it off, we’ve taken these boards even deeper with exposed Black Burle veneers. While you’re all probably familiar with the Fat Wave and Fault Line shapes, we’re also introducing the Strand for the first time ever in a 7 ply Maple construction. Some vivid graphics on some solid shapes are sure to make all your trips wild with The Deep Collection.

    Since Sector 9 was founded by surfers in Ja Jolla, California (you should know this by now), it’s only fitting that our boards would be heavily surf-inspired throughout the years. This year’s Swell Photo Collection is no different. For this year’s offering, we’ve headed South… way South... to feature photographer Hayden Richards a.k.a. Rich Richards a.k.a. SA Rips. Hailing from South Australia, his photography is stark contrast to the bright, colorful, sun-soaked barrels you’re probably accustomed to seeing don our decks. The moody, serene and often dark images of barren stretches and isolated landscapes are punctuated by ocean views and perfect barrels. We’ve chosen to compliment the subtlety of his images with flat, matte bottom graphics on some surf-inspired shapes like the Jammer and Unagi, as well as an all-around favorite in the Meridian. We’re super stoked to show off his incredible images with this collection that’ll have you transported to the other side in search of ocean perfection.

    Nothing says Sector 9 Bamboo quite like colorful, island vibes. We wanted to revive some of our Bamboo roots (get it?... ‘cause it’s a weed) and thought someone living the island lifestyle would be ideal for creating this collection. With that in mind, we’ve once again collaborated with waterman and artist Kenny Vidinich, head of OneVibe Creative Studios, which is located on the waters of Maunalua Bay in east Honolulu, O'ahu. Taking inspiration from the local flora, fauna, and more importantly waves, Kenny created some amazingly detailed and colorful illustrations of some epic surf spots. We’re super stoked to bring his island paradise back on full display with a returning classic shape in the Snapper, as well as perennial heavy hitters in the Striker and Maverick.

We’re stoked to introduce our latest artist collection from Brazilian illustrator, Pedro Correa. His work can be found in everything from magazines, to gig posters, to museum galleries, and now gracing his own Sector 9 collection. We’ve chosen Pedro’s super detailed visions of terror from the depths of outer space in his signature, muted color palette for a well-rounded quiver of shapes in the Chop Hop, Fractal and Dropper. The blackness of ocean depths meets the blackness of uncharted space in these all new anxiety-inducing graphics. Makes us wonder what’s really out there!

    Whether it’s across the world, to the bottom of the sea, or the furthest reaches of space, it feels like this year’s boards are all about taking a trip. It makes sense considering we make skateboards, but the trip doesn’t always have to be so crazy or involved. We’ve taken the idea that a journey can be as easy as travelling to the beach for the day, and we’ve embraced that simplicity in the new Vagabond Bamboo Collection. The decks are dipped in dark, muted colors over Caramelized Bamboo bottom plies with natural Bamboo stringers. This simple treatment is complimented by clean badges showing various beach landscapes, created by returning illustrator and artist, Daniel Sheridan. We want you to get out there one way or another, and the Vagabond Bamboo Collection is a perfect start.

    description: `Are you ready to take a trip? Well, you’ve come to the right place. The Journey Walnut Collection is here to expand your consciousness... and your quiver. We tapped artist, Curtis Hadzicki, to create these graphics. He drew slight inspiration from ancient Greek mythology with a psychedelic, Southern California twist. The simple graphic silhouettes serve to provide a stark contrast with the Walnut bottom plies. To further expand these board’s horizons, we sprayed the tails and used clear grip to provide one of our most unique collections to date.

    description: `SWELL PHOTO COLLECTION

    Since Sector 9 was founded by surfers in Ja Jolla, California (you should know this by now), it’s only fitting that our boards would be heavily surf-inspired throughout the years. This year’s Swell Photo Collection is no different. For this year’s offering, we’ve headed South… way South... to feature photographer Hayden Richards a.k.a. Rich Richards a.k.a. SA Rips. Hailing from South Australia, his photography is stark contrast to the bright, colorful, sun-soaked barrels you’re probably accustomed to seeing don our decks. The moody, serene and often dark images of barren stretches and isolated landscapes are punctuated by ocean views and perfect barrels. We’ve chosen to compliment the subtlety of his images with flat, matte bottom graphics on some surf-inspired shapes like the Jammer and Unagi, as well as an all-around favorite in the Meridian. We’re super stoked to show off his incredible images with this collection that’ll have you transported to the other side in search of ocean perfection.
